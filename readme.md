# Godot 3 to 4: getting up to speed

A collection of free demos, videos, and guides to help you get up to speed with new features in Godot 4. 

It should be a useful reference to all kinds of Godot users, beginners and experienced people alike. This is not a step-by-step course, but rather a collection of short how to videos and bite-sized demos to fill the gaps between the available tutorials out there.

If you are completely new to Godot, we are preparing a free series to get you started with Godot 4 directly. Join the [GDQuest Discord community](https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z) to engage with friendly Godot users and get notified when the getting started series comes out.

In this repository, you will find the source code for many of the examples shown in the "up to speed" series. Some of the videos' examples come from different projects that are also free and open source. You will find links to them in the relevant guides on our website.

For demos of all the great new features in Godot 4, check out our other repository, [Godot 4: New Features demos](https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-4-new-features).
